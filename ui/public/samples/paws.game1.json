An endorsement will burn the token but give the holder a percentage of the game income upon completion (e.g. 5%).\n\n We are run entirely by 5D LUVR volunteers and we couldn‚Äôt do any of the above without our brilliant band of 5D LUVR volunteers who give up their time to provide for their LUV Tribe. We are always looking to recruit new 5D LUVR volunteers, please join the LUV NFT Market discord to find out more.",
