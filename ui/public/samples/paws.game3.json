    "about": "The branch aims to help cats and kittens both in branch care and working with communities to help stray or community cats and feral cats.\n\nAs a volunteer-run branch, we do not have a central adoption centre or base. The cats in our care are looked after by fosterers in either purpose built pens in their garden or dedicated foster rooms within their homes. Cats in branch care are never allowed to roam freely around houses or mix with other cats. This is to ensure we can clean the rooms and pens properly between cats and ensure effective disease control. To find out more about the welfare standards you can expect to find if you are adopting from the branch, please visit out welfare pages.\n\nWe are run entirely by volunteers and we couldn’t do any of the above without our brilliant band of volunteers who give up their time to keep the branch running. We are always looking to recruit new volunteers, please check out our volunteer page to find out more.",
